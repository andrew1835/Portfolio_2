                    <p>Hi, my name is Andrew Anthony and I'm a full-stack Web Development student at the University of Washington's coding bootcamp. 
                        <br>
                        I graduated from the University of Washington in June of 2020 with a degree in Marketing, however, my plan was to pursue a career in screenwriting and acting post graduation. In fact, during the fall of 2019, I was a Script Intern for Conan O' Brien in Los Angeles. Upon completing the internship, I decided that after I graduated from college, I would move back down to LA to pursue acting and screenwriting. Then COVID hit, and as with so many other people, I had to adjust and come up with a new plan. 
                        I spent a lot of time reflecting, and realized that, although I had enjoyed the small amount of coding I had been exposed to in my life, I had never seriously considered a career incoding. I had written it off years ago because I thought that it wasn't a creative path, but after completigin some coding tutorials, I discovered how innately creative coding truly is. I decided to go all in and signed up for this bootcamp, and I'm confident that upon graduation I'll be Employer-Competitive and looking ready to make an impact as a web developer.

                                I don't know where the future will take me exactly, but that's the fun of life. All I can do is make sure I've acquired the skills necessary to navigate life and rise to meet opportunities that cross my path. I'm confident that, when it comes to jobs, having my combination of storytelling, marketing, and programming skills will make me a strong employee candidate, and a valuable addition to any company that will hire me.
